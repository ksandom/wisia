# wisia

Was it something I ate. - A Tool for tracking symptoms and possible causes in the hope of finding correlations.

I'm still adding more things you can track, so there may end up being quite a few. I once heard someone say "food, sleep, exercise; if you're failing those, you're failing life." So I think those a are a good place to start.

* `--ate`
* `--slept`
* `--exercise`

Type `wisia` without parameters for a list of things you can do.
